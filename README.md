## MongoDB Setup

### MongoDB Configuration

1. **Create a MongoDB Database**:
   - If you're using MongoDB Atlas, go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to create an account and set up a cluster.
   - If you're using a local MongoDB instance, ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend project and add the following environment variable for the MongoDB connection:
     ```bash
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myCarManagementApp?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```
     Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB credentials if using MongoDB Atlas, or use your local MongoDB connection string if running locally.

3. **Connect to MongoDB**:
   - In your backend code (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`), use the following code to connect to MongoDB:
     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');

     mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
         useNewUrlParser: true,
         useUnifiedTopology: true,
     })
     .then(() => console.log('MongoDB connected'))
     .catch(err => console.log(err));
     ```

4. **Database Models**:
   - Define your MongoDB models for User and Car (or other necessary entities) in your backend. Example:
   
   **User Model (user.js)**:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       username: { type: String, required: true },
       email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
       password: { type: String, required: true },
       cars: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Car' }],
   });

   module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
